# Contributing

## Got a Question or Problem?
Do not open issues for general support questions as I want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
If you are a company, you can reach out to `support@quite.rocks` to acquire a support contract or use the discussions section.

To save your and my time, I will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect you to `support@quite.rocks` or the discussions section.

## Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help me by submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mathisloge/quite/issues).

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
Before you start on working on a larger fix or feature, please get in touch with me via the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mathisloge/quite/issues) to streamline any work.

The types should be used as described.
