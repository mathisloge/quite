# QUITE!

quite is a new UI testing framework specifically designed for applications built on the Qt framework.
It aims to provide developers and testers with an efficient way to automate the testing of Qt application user interfaces.

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, and contributions that can help make quite a robust and reliable UI testing framework!

## Which library should I use?

Only the quite::test library or the python bindings are considered as end user libraries.
The other libraries are intended for low-level usage with extended functionality for e.g. the quite-studio or the code generator.
